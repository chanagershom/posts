Late last year, Oracle [announced](https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud/entry/oracle_bare_metal_cloud_services) the availability of their Bare Metal Cloud IAAS to the world.

With non-virtualized compute and microsecond inter-host network latency, the BMC is particularly suited to demanding high performance workloads.  This post covers the Cloudify integration with the Oracle BMC.
